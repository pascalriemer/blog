# Next.js 15.2.0 Configuration Updates

## Configuration Changes for Next.js 15.2.0

When upgrading to Next.js 15.2.0, several configuration changes were necessary to ensure compatibility with the new version. This document explains the changes made to the `next.config.js` file and why they were required.

### 1. Configuration API Changes

Next.js 15.2.0 introduced several configuration API changes that required updates to our existing configuration:

#### Moving `serverComponentsExternalPackages` to `serverExternalPackages`

In Next.js 15.2.0, the `experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages` option has been moved to the top-level as `serverExternalPackages`. This change recognizes that Server Components are now a stable feature in Next.js.

**Before:**
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['jsonwebtoken', 'jws'],
    // Other experimental features
  },
  // Other config
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  serverExternalPackages: ['jsonwebtoken', 'jws'],
  experimental: {
    // Other experimental features
  },
  // Other config
}
```

### 2. Build Process Improvements

In addition to the configuration changes, we also enhanced our Docker build process to work better with Next.js 15.2.0:

1. **Memory Allocation**: We now consistently allocate increased memory for the build process to handle the Next.js build requirements.

2. **Build Arguments**: Added environment variables as build arguments to better control the build:
   ```bash
   --build-arg NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
   --build-arg NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=4096"
   ```

3. **Dependency Installation**: Updated the dependency installation process to use `--legacy-peer-deps` to resolve conflicts between Next.js 15 and packages with older peer dependencies.

### 3. Testing the Configuration

After making these changes, we tested the configuration by:

1. Building a Docker image with the new configuration
2. Verifying that the Next.js application builds successfully
3. Ensuring that all Server Components work correctly
4. Validating that external packages like `jsonwebtoken` function properly

### Configuration Migration Guidance

When migrating to Next.js 15.2.0 or newer, follow these steps:

1. Review the Next.js upgrade guide for your specific version
2. Check for deprecated or moved configuration options
3. Move `experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages` to `serverExternalPackages`
4. Remove any other deprecated experimental features
5. Update webpack configuration if necessary
6. Test the build process thoroughly
